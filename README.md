# Discover STEM: Programming for Robot Control

Oh hey. Here is the code for our tutorial session. 

# Running the Code

To get started do the following thing.

* Open a terminal.
  - Click on the thing on the lower right.
  - Search for `terminal`
* Paste in the following commands (either right click or `Ctrl-Shift-v`)

```
git clone https://github.com/AndyLamperski/DiscoverSTEM.git
cd DiscoverSTEM
./buildEnvironment
```

* Press `Enter`
* This should install the required software and then open a browser window or tab.
* You may get a message saying "Authentication Required". Just click cancel till it goes away. (3 clicks seems to work.)
* Click on `tutorial.ipynb` in the browser

# If you need to restart

If something weird should happen, you may need to restart the tutorial. 

* Paste the commands into the terminal

```
jupyter notebook
```

* Press `Enter`
* If the "Authentication Required" box comes up, click "Cancel" till it goes away.
* Click on `tutorial.ipynb`
